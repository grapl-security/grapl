# TODO: Add the lint checks for the following conditions:
# - All container images really are accounted for in the "all" group
# - No group includes any target that starts with "_"
# - Targets that start with "_" can only appear in `inherits` lists
#   - Should *only* targets that begin with "_" appear in `inherits` lists?
# - All the targets in the "cloudsmith-images" group are configured
#   with the `upstream_aware_tag` function
# - All the targets *not* in the "cloudsmith-images" group are *not*
#   configured with the `upstream_aware_tag` function
# - Introspect all targets to find all context directories and ensure
#   that a .dockerignore file exists in each location

# Variables
########################################################################
# Variables in this section are intended to be set by users to
# influence the build.

# IMAGE_TAG is the "master variable"; if it is set to something other
# than "latest", we will build images suitable for production
# usage. If it is unset, "dev", or "latest", we'll be creating images for
# local usage only.
#
# In general, you'll only set this (via an environment variable when
# invoking `docker buildx bake`) when you want to set a real version
# tag and create images to push to Cloudsmith.
#
# For everyday local developer usage, you shouldn't need to change
# this value.
#
# See the `upstream_aware_tag` function below for additional
# information.
variable "IMAGE_TAG" {
  default = ""

# TODO: Document pushing to a sandbox repository, or rework the
# variables and functions to accommodate that.
# IMAGE_TAG=XXX RUST_BUILD=debug CONTAINER_REGISTRY=XXX/my-repo

# Variables below are generally not intended to be set by users. You
# can if you know what you're doing, but they're really meant to
# encapsulate some core logic for how we build. Override them at your
# own risk!
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# If IMAGE_TAG is either unset or "latest", or "dev", we are *not* doing builds
# for production usage. Production usage implies three things:
#
# - We're pushing our images to our Cloudsmith repository
# - We *never* going to use a "latest" tag. Ever. Only
#   explicitly-versioned images
# - Rust builds will use a "release" build profile
#
# NOTE: unset and "latest" are equivalent; "dev" is our local
# convention. We use Nomad and Nomad will not use a "latest"-tagged
# image from the local machine, so we have to have something that
# plays well for local developers.
#
variable "RELEASE_BUILD" {
  default = not(contains(["", "latest", "dev"], "${IMAGE_TAG}"))
