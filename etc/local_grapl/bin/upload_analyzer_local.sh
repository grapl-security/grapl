# NOTE: These values are copied from local-grapl.env. It's
# unfortunate, yes, but in the interests of a decent
# user-experience, we'll eat that pain for now. In the near term,
# we should pull this functionality into something like graplctl
# with a more formalized way of pointing to a specific Grapl
# instance.
