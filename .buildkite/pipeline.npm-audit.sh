# Dynamically generate a pipeline for running npm audit. It's only
# dynamic because we need a way to control the `soft_fail` behavior.
#
# If we're running in the context of the `grapl/npm-audit` pipeline
# (on a weekly schedule) we want to fail, because then we can get
# notified in Slack, etc.
#
# If we're running elsewhere, such as `grapl/verify` or `grapl/merge`,
# then we want to be able to fail this job without failing the whole
# pipeline; in that scenario, it's purely an advisory job.
#
# Absent a dynamically-generated pipeline like this, there isn't
# really a good way to achieve this without a lot of duplication.
