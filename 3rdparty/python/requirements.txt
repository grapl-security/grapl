# This is only pinned to ensure that we get the latest Pulumi; for
# some reason, leaving it unpinned resulted in an older version being
# pulled in. Feel free to update this pin as needed (there's nothing
# magical about 3.40.2; it's just what was current when this was
# written), or even remove it if it is no longer needed.
