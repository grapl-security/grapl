# Observability

We currently use [Lightstep](https://lightstep.com) as our observability
platform.

## Local tracing

1. Go to [lightstep.com](https://lightstep.com)
1. Log into lightstep using google.
1. On the left-hand side menu go to developer mode (the angle brackets `< >`).
1. Copy the command and run that locally. This will spin up a docker container
   configured with an api key. Any data submitted will be forwarded to
   Lightstep.
1. Run `make up`. Once everything is up, check the Lightstep developer mode
   page. You should start seeing traces appear on the page.
