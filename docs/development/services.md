## Grapl Services - main pipeline
Unless otherwise specified, the input to a service is the output of the one described above it.


### Graph Generator
**Input:** Event logs (e.g. sysmon logs, osquery logs, Cloudtrail logs) from the customer's S3 bucket.

**Work:** Turns these events into a standalone subgraph, independent of existing Dgraph state.

**Output:** Stores the subgraph to S3 for Node Identifier.


### Node Identifier
**Work:** Identifies nodes in the incoming subgraph against the canonical identities of nodes in DynamoDB. The incoming nodes may be new, or they may represent something already known in the master graph.

For instance, an incoming subgraph may refer to a process `{PID:1234, name: "coolthing.exe", started at 1:00AM}`; it's possible that Dgraph already has a node representing this exact same process. We'd like to de-duplicate this process node.

**Output:** TODO


### Graph Merger
**Work:** Write the new edges and nodes from Node Identifier to Dgraph.

**Output:** TODO (it looks like exactly the same as node identifier's output, just re-encoded?)


### Analyzer Dispatcher
**Work:** Determines which analyzers to execute against recently merged graphs

**Output:** TODO


### Analyzer Executor
**Work:** Executes queries against Dgraph, and - upon a successful query hit - determines which lenses and risk nodes to create

**Output:** A JSON dump of risks and lenses to be created by the Engagement Creator (see `analyzer_executor.py#emit_event` for specifics)


### Engagement Creator
**Work:** Simply appends the risks and lenses described in its input to Dgraph.

**Output:** Nothing is written to S3; the desired output is a mutation to Dgraph.


## Other services
### Metric Forwarder
**Input:** 
This services receives `stdout` from other lambdas via Cloudwatch Logs. We subscribe only to logs that contain the reserved keyword `MONITORING|`.

**Work:** Metric Forwarder parses these log lines - which are `statsd` serialized metrics - and forwards them to Cloudwatch as metrics.

### Model Plugin Deployer
TODO


### Dgraph TTL
**Work:** Every minute, prunes old subgraphs from Dgraph. (At time of writing, 'old' is defined as 365 days old.)


### Engagement UX
Provides the main customer interaction with Grapl. Mostly a view wrapper around Engagement Edge.


### Graphql Endpoint
TODO


### Engagement Edge
Provides REST APIs - primarily consumed by Engagement UX - for things like:
- Authn/Authz
- Common Dgraph queries (i.e. "List all lenses")
