Once you've written your Analyzers you'll want to deploy them to Grapl.

Analyzers live in the `<DEPLOYMENT_NAME>-grapl-analyzers`, so all we need to do
is upload the files to that bucket. If you're using a local version of Grapl the
DEPLOYMENT_NAME is always `local-grapl`.

Analyzers should be deployed with a key of the form:
`analyzer_name/main.py`.

If you're uploading to a local Grapl,
```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minioadmin \
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
aws s3 cp \
<path to analyzer> \
s3://local-grapl-analyzers-bucket/analyzers/<analyzer_name>/main.py \
--endpoint-url=http://localhost:9000
```

Otherwise, for an AWS deployed Grapl,
```bash
aws s3 cp \
<path to analyzer> \
s3://<DEPLOYMENT_NAME>-analyzers-bucket/analyzers/<analyzer_name>/main.py \
```

## Deploying from Github

We can keep our detection logic in Github, which will allow us to perform code reviews,
linting, and automate the deployment of our analyzers.

As an example, [insanitybit/grapl-analyzers](https://github.com/insanitybit/grapl-analyzers) is set up to use this webhook.

#### Deploy
To get started you'll need to install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links), and the [aws-cdk](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cdk#getting-started).

Clone the repo: 
`git clone git@github.com:insanitybit/grapl-analyzer-deployer.git`

Change directories into the `/grapl-analyzer-deployer/analyzer-deployer-cdk/` folder.

You'll need to fill out a .env file with the following and place is it in the analyzer-deployer-cdk folder.

Variables:
`GITHUB_SHARED_SECRET` The secret used by the server to authenticate the client. 
                       Consider using the output of: `ruby -rsecurerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(20)'`
`GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` This is a "Personal Access Token" generated by github.

`DEPLOYMENT_NAME` This is the unique deployment name for your Grapl deployment.

Example:

```
GITHUB_SHARED_SECRET="dba0bf0df5e2887e737990a35f356ff7e23a56c5"
GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN="58b37668a1d3f9f1fa82f1e99604d58ecbf1333b"
DEPLOYMENT_NAME="exampleco"
```

(You may need to build dependencies with npm i)
Run `./deploy.sh`

### Setting up the Webhook
https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/

Set the webhook url to the API Gateway created by your CDK deployment of Grapl.
Set the secret to the value of `GITHUB_SHARED_SECRET`.
