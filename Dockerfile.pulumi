# Use Pants to grab our dependencies
#
# NOTE: This works as long as our Pulumi code only has dependencies on
# non-Grapl Python libraries (i.e., other code in this repository). If
# that ever changes, this will also need to be revisited.
#
# These are the current bare minimum of files that we need to copy
# over in order to have pants compute our dependencies. At this stage,
# it looks kind of horrible, but it means we don't have to keep a
# requirements.txt file around for the Pulumi code. As things mature,
# this will get simplified.
