    environment:
      # Since we will be writing files back to our workstation, they
      # must be owned by our workstation user. This means we will run
      # the container with `--user=$(id --user):$(id --group)`, which
      # generally yields a user ID of 1000. Since there is no such
      # user in the `bufbuild/buf` container, we are effectively
      # anonymous. In such cases, `$HOME` in the container will be `/`.
      #
      # When formatting, `buf` needs to write to `${HOME}/.cache`.
      # Since our anonymous user will not have permissions to write to
      # `/.cache`, we must modify the value of `$HOME` to a location
      # where we *do* have write permissions.  Using `/workdir` will
      # result in a `.cache` directory being created in the repository
      # root on our workstations, but it will actually allow this to
      # *work*, so it's a small price to pay.
