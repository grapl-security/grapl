# Contributing to Grapl

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Grapl! Community
contributions such as yours are one of the key factors which
differentiate Grapl in the DFIR ecosystem. This document is intended
as a guide to help you contribute as effectively as possible.

First, please read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We
expect all contributors to follow it.

## Types of contributions

Here are some of the ways you can contribute to Grapl. All
contributions are welcome, this is not meant to be an exhaustive list.

  - Feature requests or bug reports
  - Documentation
  - Plugins
  - Core features

### Feature requests or bug reports

First, if you believe that you have identified a security
vulnerability which affects Grapl users, please do not open a public
GitHub issue. Instead, please contact us via email at
[security-reports@graplsecurity.com](mailto:security-reports@graplsecurity.com),
and we will work with you to resolve it safely and quickly.

For all non-sensitive feature request or bug reports, please open a
[Bug report GitHub
Issue](https://github.com/grapl-security/grapl/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)
containing a detailed, reproducible description of the problem. It may
be useful to discuss the issue before opening one in GitHub, if you'd
like you may reach out via Slack at
[grapl-dfir.slack.com](https://grapl-dfir.slack.com), but this is not
a requirement.

### Changes to code or documentation

Grapl is organized as a monorepo with the following structure:

``` text
/grapl
├──etc
│  ├──images
│  ├──local_grapl
│  └──sample_data
└──src
   ├──js
   │  └──{ js services …
   ├──python
   │  └──{ python services …
   └──rust
      └──{ rust services …
```

We use `docker-compose` for local development. To execute a Grapl
debug build, execute the following command in the project root:

``` bash
docker-compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.build.yml \
  build --build-arg release_target=debug
```

Note that the `--build-arg release_target=debug` is redundant, but
it's shown here because if you want to execute a release build you
can use `--build-arg release_target=release`.

We currently rely on some unsupported and undocumented behavior of
`docker-compose build` to build intermediate containers in dependency
order, so unfortunately `docker-compose build --parallel` will not
work. The way forward will probably be to use a dedicated build
automation tool like [Dobi](https://github.com/dnephin/dobi). See
https://github.com/grapl-security/grapl/issues/86.

To run your images locally, execute the following command in the
project root:

``` bash
docker-compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.build.yml \
  up
```

See [these docs](https://grapl-analyzerlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup/local/)
for a more in-depth guide to operating Grapl locally.

We heartily welcome code contributions, but we request for the sake of
planning and project management that each contribution be associated
with an open issue. Please communicate with us before starting
development so we can make sure everyone is on the same page and avoid
wasting time and effort.

Pull requests should be made against the `staging` branch. We will
deploy and test all changes in our staging environment before merging
them into `master`.

#### Documentation

Documentation is definitely a work-in-progress at this point. In the
likely event you find it lacking, please open a [Documentation request
GitHub
Issue](https://github.com/grapl-security/grapl/issues/new?template=documentation_request.md).
For minor edits for spelling, correctness, grammar, etc., don't worry
about opening an issue, just submit a PR.

#### Plugins

Grapl aims to provide a rich plugin ecosystem to integrate with
external systems. If you have any suggestions for new plugin
integrations please open a [Plugin request GitHub
Issue](https://github.com/grapl-security/grapl/issues/new?template=plugin_request.md).

#### Core features

For updates to Grapl's core functionality please open a [Feature request GitHub
Issue](https://github.com/grapl-security/grapl/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).

#### Other issues

For any issue not covered in the rest of this document, please feel
free to open a [blank GitHub
Issue](https://github.com/grapl-security/grapl/issues/new?template=blank_issue.md). Please
include as much information as you can to help us address it.
