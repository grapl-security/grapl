name: Release :main to Dockerhub
# The original motivation here was to provide working, latest-ish images of all
# services so that external repos like the Cloudtrail generator could test
# against the latest version of `main` without having to compile it.
# 
# As of cloudtrail 9b416d, we actually don't use this anymore; 
# it's not the end of the world if we decide to remove it. 

on:
  # Every time we push to main
  # release that to Dockerhub with the tag 'main'.
