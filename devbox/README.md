# Devbox

While most Grapl development can take place on our company-provided laptops,
some tasks - particularly when we get into topics like mounting or kernel
modules - require a real Linux box and not just a Chrome OS Crostini container.

The Devbox suite of scripts provisions an EC2 box for this purpose.
