# Nomad by default supplies 300MB RAM.

## Total memory allocated to the Nomad task is set to 1024MB in
## grapl-local-infra.nomad.
##
## From the configuration values set below, maximum total memory usage should
## be:
##
##     shared_buffers
##   + effective_cache_size
##   + maintenance_work_mem
##   + 100 * work_mem
##   = 508MB
##
## which I hereby swear is sufficiently less than 512MB = 1024MB / 2.
##
## N.B.: whenever you touch this file make sure you do the calculation, update
## this comment, and read it out loud to ensure the maximum total memory usage
## doesn't exceed the memory allocated to the Nomad task. Also check the
## database error logs to make sure. Otherwise the database will OOM, causing
## strange and mysterious happenings.
