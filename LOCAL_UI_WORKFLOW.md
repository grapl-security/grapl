# Local UI Development Workflow

The following describes a basic workflow for developing the Grapl
frontend locally. The commands should be run from the repository root.

---

Run `make up`; this will just be going in a terminal in the
background. If you need to tear this all down and start over at any
point, make sure you run `make down` before running make up again.

The UI should be available at http://localhost:1234/index.html
