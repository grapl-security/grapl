[build]
# These compiler lints are warnings by default, but our codebase
# currently has a number of violations of each. This causes rather
# noisy build output, so until we can clean them up, we'll globally
# allow them here. This ensures consistent behavior across all builds
# (build, test, check, clippy, etc.), in all environments
# (workstation, editor integration, CI, etc.).
#
# Once they've all been cleaned up, we can replace them all with
# `--deny=warnings`.
