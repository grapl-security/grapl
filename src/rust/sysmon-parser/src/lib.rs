//! # (Unofficial) Sysmon XML parser
//!
//! This parses Sysmon events from Windows Events XML. Events from [Sysmon for Linux] have been
//! tested against the library, which appear to have similar schemas.
//!
//! Sysmon schemas used for creating this libary can be found the in `/etc` directory. These were
//! provided by Sysmon (ex: `Sysmon64.exe -s`).
//!
//! This version has been tested against events from the following versions of Sysmon:
//! - System Monitor v13.33 (Windows)
//! - Sysmon For Linux v1.0.0 (Linux)
//!
//! # Event types
//!
//! Not all events types from Sysmon are currently supported. For such events the [`System`] will
//! still parse, but the [`SysmonEvent::event_data`] will be the [`EventData::Unsupported`]
//! variant. The types that currently are supported are:
//!
//!   - [FileCreate]
//!   - [NetworkConnect]
//!   - [ProcessCreate]
//!   - [ProcessTerminate]
//!
//! # Data types
//!
//! Different versions of Sysmon will different schemas for event data. To handle these different
//! event versions, this library uses the [`std::option::Option`] type for fields that are not
//! common across all versions. This will of course present an issue for future versions that
//! decide to drop a field, requiring breaking changes. Instead of putting all field behind the
//! [`std::option::Option`] type to account for this future versions of this library will provide a
//! serde interface, which will let users define the data types they'd like to deserialize to.
//!
//! Sysmon appears to use a sentinel value `-` for fields where data is not present. Instead of
//! attempting to interpret such meaning from these values by using the [`std::option::Option`]
//! type, this will make no such assumptions about the data, and will return the value from Sysmon.
//!
//! # Known issues
//!
//! 1. [xmlparser] is used for parsing the input XML, which supports XML 1.0 only, and verifies the
//! XML adheres the to 1.0 spec. However, Sysmon _may_ include characters that are not valid for
//! the XML 1.0 spec. This includes control characters, which can show up in command line strings
//! on Linux.
//!
//! 2. The error reporting needs improvement. For parsing errors, like parsing ints, the errors
//! at the moment only report that there was a ParseIntError, but it doesn't include the other
//! helpful information like the text that failed parsing, or where in the input it can be found.
//! This will be improved in future versions.
