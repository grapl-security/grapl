# We do the following things to the default node container:
#1. Upgrade the yarn version
#2. We set the permissions for the docker mount points

########## Upgrade Yarn Version ############################
# The official node containers all use yarnv1, which is old and not really supported anymore. Therefore we're setting
# yarn to the latest stable v3 version explicitly. With this we'll also be able to enable features like zero installs

# TODO switch to corepack once
#`typescript@patch:typescript@npm%3A4.6.2#~builtin<compat/typescript>::version=4.6.2&hash=493e53: Cannot apply hunk #11`
# error is fixed. Apparently corepack applies a strict setting, which yarn set doesn't.

ENV YARN_VERSION 3.2.3

# Don't think this is necessarily an issue for us:

RUN yarn set version ${YARN_VERSION}

########## Set docker mount points mode ###################
# Manually create Docker volume mount points so we can set the mode
# to make them a+w.
